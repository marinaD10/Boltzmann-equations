# Boltzmann-equations
# Leptogenesis Simulation

This repository contains Python code used to simulate the generation of the baryon asymmetry of the universe via thermal leptogenesis. It includes numerical solutions to Boltzmann equations under different initial conditions for the lightest heavy neutrino N₁.

## 📄 Contents

- `Leptogenesis_mass_bounds.py`: Main script for solving the Boltzmann equations and plotting results.
- `Plots.png`: The generated plots showing efficiency vs. effective neutrino mass and required M₁ vs. effective neutrino mass.

## 🔧 Features

- Supports different initial conditions:
  - Thermal abundance
  - Dominant N₁
- Computes:
  - Efficiency factor κ
  - Lower bound on M₁ 
- Log-log plots for visual clarity

## 📊 Example Output

- Efficiency vs. m̃₁
- Minimum M₁ for successful baryogenesis
